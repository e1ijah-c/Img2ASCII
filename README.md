    A simple program to revisualise images as ASCII text.

## üöÄ About the Project
> _Img2ASCII is <ins>free to use</ins> and serves as a personal coding project that has intrigued me ever since watching [this](https://youtu.be/gg40RWiaHRY?si=JBFu_-3ykr3s3N7P) YouTube video on 'ASCII Rendering' by [Acerola](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell)._

Written in _**Python**_ and utilising the [**_Pillow_**](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library ‚Äî it generates uploaded images as if comprised of ASCII characters. The program aims to be straightforward and uncomplicated,
built for those who want to achieve the familiar 'retro' aesthetic for their art without spending hours typing out individual characters. 

### How It Works




## üìò Getting Started 
> Img2ASCII was built on Python (ver. 3.13) using Pillow (ver. 11.2.1), hence these versions are recommended to ensure the program functions as intended.

### Prerequisites
- _Python_ (ver. 3.13 or later) ‚Äî see [this guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) for installation help.
- _Pillow_ (ver. 11.2.1 or later)

### Installation
1. Install the latest verion of [_pip_](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for _Python_.
```bash
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

2. Install _Pillow_ library using pip
```bash
python3 -m pip install pillow
```

3. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/e1ijah-c/Img2ASCII.git
```

4. Set git remote url to avoid pushes to base project
```bash
git remote set-url origin  https://github.com/e1ijah-c/Img2ASCII.git
git remote -v
```

## üöô Roadmap

- [x] Make working program
- [ ] Finish README file
- [ ] Improve output quality by first increasing contrast of original image
    - [ ] Implement outlines using Sobel Filter?
- [ ] Create simple GUI using TKinter
